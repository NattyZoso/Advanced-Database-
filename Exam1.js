Problem #7



Now, we want to find the most popular twitter user but we are interested in how many people re-tweet their tweets. This might tell us which of our users release the most interesting tweets.

Write the mongo client command to see the twitter users in descending order based on the average re-tweet counts. Only return the user_name, user_followers_count, user_friends_count, re-tweet-average and number-of-tweets.

Hint: Use items from the previous question. The projection should be almost the same as the previous question.
